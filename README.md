# 🌐 Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my developer portfolio!

This site is a curated space where I showcase the projects I've built, the skills I bring to the table, and a bit about the person behind the code. It’s designed to reflect not just what I can do technically, but also my eye for design, user experience, and storytelling.

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a junior developer with a background in media and marketing, blending creativity with code to build websites that are beautiful, accessible, and genuinely user-focused. While I focus on front-end development, I’ve also worked across the stack and love learning new technologies that enhance what I build.

This portfolio is a reflection of how I approach my work: thoughtfully, visually, and always with the user in mind.
