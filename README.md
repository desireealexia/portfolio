## 🚀 About Me
I'm a front-end developer with a background in media and marketing, blending creativity with code to build websites that are beautiful, accessible, and genuinely useful. Whether it's a sleek e-commerce site or a fun web app, I love working at the intersection of design and development.

This portfolio is a reflection of how I approach my work: thoughtfully, visually, and always with the user in mind.
